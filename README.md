# NIST CSF Internal Security Audit

This repository contains an internal cybersecurity audit conducted using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.  
The audit evaluates security controls, compliance posture, and overall risk exposure for a fictional organization, based on a realistic enterprise scenario.

The project focuses on control gap analysis, regulatory alignment, and risk-driven security recommendations, following standard industry audit and GRC practices.

- Organization-wide internal security audit
- Asset identification and risk assessment
- Evaluation of existing security controls
- Compliance assessment against major standards
- High-level recommendations for risk reduction

The audited organization (**Botium Toys**) is fictional and used strictly for educational and portfolio purposes.
